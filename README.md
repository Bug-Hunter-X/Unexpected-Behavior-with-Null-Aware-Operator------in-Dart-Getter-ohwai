# Dart Null-Aware Operator Pitfall

This repository demonstrates a potential issue when using the null-aware operator (??) in getter methods in Dart.  The bug arises when a null value is assigned to a private variable, and the getter attempts to use the ?? operator to provide a default value. While seemingly harmless, this can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled correctly within the context of the program.

The solution provides a clear and effective fix, enhancing the robustness of the code and ensuring reliable results in all scenarios.
